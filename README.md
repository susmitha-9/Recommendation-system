# Recommendation-system
National Institute rank prediction using Machine Learning

• Built a ranking-prediction and recommendation engine on multi-year NIRF indicators (TLR, RP, GO, OI, PR) using gradient-boosted trees + SHAP, forecasting next-year ranks with [MAE] error and R².
• Operationalized prescriptive guidance via counterfactual optimization that recommends the minimal indicator improvements required to hit a target rank, cutting planning error for leadership scenarios.
• Validated robustness with k-fold CV and year-over-year drift checks; delivered an interactive dashboard (Python/Streamlit/Plotly) so stakeholders can simulate “what-if” improvements by department and budget.
